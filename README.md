## 🔬 About
I'm a **Postdoctoral Researcher at CNRS / LSCE (France)** working on fire–climate–land cover interactions across different regions of the world.

My research integrates **remote sensing**, **climate data**, and **ecological modeling** to understand how landscape structure and atmospheric conditions shape fire dynamics — from the **South American Gran Chaco** to **Southeast Asia** and **Southern Africa**.

## 🌍 Main Research Topics
- **Fire dynamics** and morphology under varying climate regimes  
- **Deforestation and agriculture expansion** in tropical and subtropical landscapes  
- **AI and high-resolution land-cover mapping (ESA HRLC)**  
- **Vegetation productivity (EVI, LAI, Biomass)** and land degradation  
- **Wind and topographic controls** on fire spread
- **Anthropogenic drivers**

## 📰 Updates
The full bilingual (EN/ES) version of the website is under development.  
It will include dedicated sections for:
- Publications  
- Projects  
- Maps and visualizations  
- News and outreach
